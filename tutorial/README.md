### Source of data:

In this tutorial we will use data from the following paper:

    Henry, Charles S., Katherine L. Taylor, and James B. Johnson. "A new lacewing species of the Chrysoperla carnea species-group from central Asia associated with conifers (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)." Journal of Natural History 53.21-22 (2019): 1277-1300.

These data are a subset of data collected for a larger project studying the phylogeny of green lacewings (_Chrysoperla_). The paper used these data to support the description of a new lacewing species in the _Chrysoperla carnea_ species group from central Asia, _Chrysoperla duelli_. Lacewings in this group are morphologically identical, but have distinctive courtship songs. _C. duelli's_ song, however, is highly similar to a song by another species in the group that lives in North America, _C. downesi_. 

The original data consist of 3 RAD libraries, each containing 47 barcoded samples. The authors used SbfI to digest genomic DNA, then randomly sheared and sequenced a single end on the Illumina platform. 

33 of these samples are used in Henry et al (HTJ). Here I synthesize a multiplexed pool of the 33 HTJ samples from the original larger pools to demonstrate a RAD analysis from start to finish (see directory "data_generation"). 

Scripts for exploratory analysis of the entire dataset are located in "../analysis"
