### Source of data:

Henry, Charles S., Katherine L. Taylor, and James B. Johnson. "A new lacewing species of the Chrysoperla carnea species-group from central Asia associated with conifers (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae)." Journal of Natural History 53.21-22 (2019): 1277-1300.

These data are a subset of data collected for a larger project studying the phylogeny of the group. 

The original data consist of 3 RAD libraries, each containing 47 barcoded samples. The authors used SbfI to digest genomic DNA, then randomly sheared and sequenced a single end on the Illumina platform. 

Here I recreate a multiplexed pool of samples from the original larger pool to demonstrate a RAD analysis from start to finish (see directory "data_generation")

Scripts for exploratory analysis of the entire dataset are located in "../analysis"
